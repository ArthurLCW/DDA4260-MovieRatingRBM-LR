# DDA4260-MovieRatingRBM-LR
Homework of movie rating done by RBM and LR. This is the homework of 'DDA4260 Networked Life' from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). 

We use two methods to implement films rating which are linear regression implemented by Dongyang Wu and restricted Boltzmann machine implemented by Changwen Li (the owner of this github project). Mr. Dongyang Wu has agreed on the sharing of the codes. The project contains source code and report. 

The best RMSE on test dataset (unknown to students, only visible for professor and TA) is 0.8717. Our code is for knowledge share. Please DO NOT copy our codes.
